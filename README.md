# mltz_base

The purpose of this module is simply to simplify ML learning and use best practices while developing ML models. 

**Standardization**: The mltz-base project is an attempt to standardize the way ML projects are structured within a team or organization, promoting best practices for organization, testing, and documentation.

**Flexibility**: mltz-base seems is designed with flexibility in mind. Users can likely use different parts of the codebase as needed, and extend or modify components to suit their specific requirements.

**Extensibility**: mltz-base could be used as a starting point for building more complex, domain-specific machine learning libraries. The name mltz-base itself is intended to be a "**base**" or foundation upon which other things can be built.
