    "# Transformer from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a Transformer from scratch is an educational journey into the inner workings of one of the most influential models in the field of Natural Language Processing. Here's why focusing on this process can be so beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Understanding**: Utilizing pre-trained models or libraries can often lead to a surface-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms. On the other hand, creating a Transformer model from the ground up facilitates a deep, granular comprehension of each part of this complex architecture. You'll intimately understand the self-attention mechanism, positional encoding, layer normalization, and the importance of masks, among other concepts, as these are all pieces you'll have to create and interconnect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Educational Value**: Implementing a Transformer from scratch is akin to a hands-on masterclass in advanced deep learning. It's an effective method of learning that goes beyond theory, encouraging you to apply knowledge and solve problems as they arise. It enables you to grapple with the practical aspects of model development, including debugging, ensuring computational efficiency, and managing resourcesâ€”a real-life skill set often omitted in theoretical coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deeper Insights into NLP**: Transformers form the backbone of modern NLP, powering applications from translation to text generation. By building a Transformer yourself, you'll gain insights into why they're so effective for handling language data and how different components contribute to their exceptional performance. This can be a stepping stone to further explorations and innovations in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insight into Generative AI**: Transformers have revolutionized not just NLP, but the broader domain of generative AI as well. They lie at the core of cutting-edge models like GPT-3 that can generate human-like text, and have also found applications in areas like music and image generation. By constructing a Transformer from scratch, you'll gain a foundational understanding of the principles that drive these powerful generative models. This equips you to participate in and contribute to the ongoing advancements in this rapidly evolving field, whether by optimizing existing generative models or pioneering new approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while using pre-built models has its advantages, nothing quite matches the depth of understanding and learning achieved by building a Transformer model from scratch. It's an endeavor that requires dedication and effort, but the resultant knowledge and skills gained make it a worthwhile investment for any serious learner or practitioner in the field of NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](imgs/attention-enc-decoder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I have decided to embark on this journey of building a Transformer from scratch, inspired by the significant advancements and prolific literature available in the field. There's a rich body of resources and scholarly articles, tutorials, and code repositories that break down the complexity of the Transformer architecture, serving as invaluable guides and references. I'm particularly grateful to those brave pioneers who ventured into uncharted territory and shared their experiences and insights. Their work has illuminated the path for others and has been instrumental in making these complex concepts more accessible to the broader AI community. Through this endeavor, I hope to deepen my own understanding of Transformer models, while also contributing to the growing body of knowledge on this subject.\n"

    "## Getting Started with Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "I am familiar with [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and I will be using it to build the Transformer, but you can use any framework you prefer. As a developer, I find it helpful to have a clear plan of action before starting a project. This helps me stay focused and motivated, and also ensures that I don't get lost in the details. The famous paper ([Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)) is a must read. I will be using the same notation as the paper as much as possible, so it's important to understand the terminology and notation used in the paper. I will also be using the same variable names as the paper, so it's helpful to have the paper open as a reference while going thru is Jupyter Notebook. Here's the high-level plan I've laid out for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I will start by building the core components of the Transformer architecture, which I will combine to create the complete the Transformer model. From a high-level I have decided to build the following components:\n",

    "    * Transformer Block (which is used in Encoder and Decoder)\n",
    "    * Encoder \n",

    "    * Decoder \n",
    "    * And finally Transformer which uses the Encoder and Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every component mentioned above will be:\n",
    "  * Defined as a [`nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html) subclass. This will allow me to leverage the built-in capabilities of PyTorch, including the ability to track and update the model parameters, compute gradients, and more.\n",
    "  * Have a corresponding unit test to ensure that it's working as expected. I will also use the unit tests to debug the code and fix any bugs that arise. \n",
    "  * Have a [`mermaid`](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) diagram to visualize the flow of data. I will use the diagrams to ensure that the dimensions of tensors match at each step, and as a visual aid to understand the model architecture.\n",

    "## But before we start, how does the data flow in a Transformer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume you have a trained Transformer model that can translate English sentences to French. Here's how the data flows through the model during prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Source Token Sequence**: This is your input sentence in English, tokenized into a sequence of word vectors. The model reads this sequence to understand the context of the input sentence. Assuming N=1 (N is the batch number or the number of sentences in the input), the shape of the tensor is (1, SeqLength), where SeqLength is the length of the sequence or the number of tokens in the English sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Source Mask**: This is applied to the source sequence. The purpose of the source mask is to prevent the attention mechanism from focusing on irrelevant parts of the input, such as padding tokens. In a batch of sequences, not all sequences will be of the same length. To make them uniform in length, padding tokens are added to the shorter sequences. These padded positions don't carry any meaningful information, and it's important to prevent the self-attention mechanism from considering these positions. A padding mask is used for this purpose. It is typically a tensor with values that are either 0 (for padding positions) or 1 (for actual data positions).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encoder**: The encoder processes the source token sequence and the source mask. Since we are in inference mode, the model isn't being trained, so the weights remain the same. The encoder's role is to create a rich representation of the source sentence that captures the semantic information of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Target Token Sequence**: At the start of the decoding process, this sequence contains only a start-of-sequence token (in this case for the French language translation). The goal of the model is to generate the rest of the sequence, token by token, which will form our translated sentence in French.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Target Mask**: This mask ensures that the prediction for each position can depend only on known outputs at earlier positions, not on future positions, maintaining the auto-regressive property.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decoder**: The decoder processes the output from the encoder, the initial target token sequence, and the target and source masks. It then generates a probability distribution for the next token (the next word in the French translation).The token (word) with the highest probability is selected and added to the target sequence. This updated target sequence is then fed back into the decoder, and the process is repeated. This generation continues until an end-of-sequence token is produced or the sequence reaches a predefined maximum length.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, during inference/prediction mode, our English-to-French Transformer model generates a French translation of the input English sentence, one word at a time, based on both the original English sentence and the French words it has generated so far.\n",

    "In machine learning, particularly in models such as Transformers, an attention function is a crucial component that enhances the model's ability to focus on specific parts of the input data that are relevant for a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an expanded explanation of the key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query, Keys, and Values**: These are terms used in the attention mechanism. The 'query' is a vector that represents the current item or context we're focusing on. 'Keys' are vectors that represent the different items or contexts available in the input data. 'Values' are vectors that represent the actual content or information associated with each key. They query and keys always have the same dimension, but the values can have the same or different dimension. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Compatibility Function**: The weights assigned to each value in the weighted sum are determined by a 'compatibility function'. This is a function that takes the query and a key as inputs, and outputs a score that represents how well the query and key match. This score is then used as the weight for the corresponding value in the weighted sum. In other words, if the query matches well with a certain key (i.e., the compatibility function gives a high score), then the corresponding value gets a high weight, and therefore has a larger influence on the output of the attention function. This is how the attention mechanism allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention Function**: This is essentially a mapping procedure. It maps a query (a representation of the current context or focus) and a set of key-value pairs (representations of the possible inputs and their corresponding outputs or 'values') to an output. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted Sum of Values**: The output of the attention function is calculated as a weighted sum of the values. This means each value vector is multiplied by a certain weight, and then all of these weighted values are added together to produce the output. The idea is to give more 'attention' (i.e., higher weight) to the values that are more relevant or useful for the current task.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](imgs/mha.png)\n",

    "**Multi-Head Attention**: The multi-head attention mechanism is a variant of the attention mechanism that allows the model to jointly attend to information from different embedding/representation subspaces at different positions. This is beneficial as it allows the model to learn more robust relationships between the query and the key-value pairs. It also helps the model to focus on different positions and subspaces of the input data at different layers of the model.\n",

    "2. **LayerNorm + Dropout (LN1)**: The output from the MHA and the original Queries (residual connection) are added together and then passed through the first Layer Normalization and Dropout operation to stabilize the outputs and prevent overfitting. The output of this stage retains the shape (N, Sq, E).\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **LayerNorm + Dropout (LN2)**: The output from the FFN and the output of LN1 (again, a residual connection) are added together, then passed through the second Layer Normalization and Dropout operation. This further stabilizes the outputs and helps prevent overfitting.\n",

The decoder block applies masked self-attention on X and then applies another attention mechanism using X as queries, ASK as keys and ASV as values.The Decoder Block's output is then passed through the same series of layers multiple times (the exact number is a parameter of the model), with each pass allowing the decoder to refine its understanding of the input sequence in the context of the output it is generating.\n",
